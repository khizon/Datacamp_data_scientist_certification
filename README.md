#Predicting Attendance Rate for a Fitness Center's Group Classes

For this Datacamp certification, I was tasked to analyze and then create a regression model that predicts the attendance rate of group classes. I have used pandas and seaborn for data validation and visualization. I then used sklearn to create pipelines that combine the preprocessing step and the regressor model. I have experimented with different regressors to get the lowest error.
